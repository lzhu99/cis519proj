This project is a comparative study of comparing performance of different machine learning models in forecasting stock prices using historical open, close, trading volume data. Models used include OLS Linear Regression, ARIMA, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The project uses the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Explained variance score, and R-squared score to evaluate models. Complex models generally have better performance than simpler models (eg. Random Forest Regressor performs better than ARIMA), but complex models does not guanrateen better results (eg. LTSM performs worse than Random Forest). Strengths and weaknesses of each model on time series data is carefully discussed. This project intends to provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of different algorithms, which can lead to the development of new and more effective approaches.
